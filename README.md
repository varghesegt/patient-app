# MediLink360 - Patient PWA (Prototype)

This is a frontend-only PWA prototype for the Patient side of MediLink360. It is built with React + Vite + Tailwind for hackathon/demo usage.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

This project uses mock services for triage, maps and SMS to make the demo fully frontend-driven.
